When hosting your Docker Compose setup on AWS EC2, you should replace `localhost` with the public DNS or public IP of your EC2 instance. This way, Caddy can accept incoming requests directed to your server from external clients.

## Example Caddyfile Configuration

### Using Public DNS or IP
If your EC2 instance's public DNS is `ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com`, your Caddyfile would look like this:

```plaintext
ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com {
  reverse_proxy gatewayapi:8000
  log {
    output stdout
    level WARN
  }
}
```

### Using a Domain Name
If you have a domain name (e.g., `example.com`), you can configure the Caddyfile like this:

```plaintext
example.com {
  reverse_proxy gatewayapi:8000
  log {
    output stdout
    level WARN
  }
}
```

### Important Steps

1. **Security Groups**: Ensure that your EC2 instance's security group allows HTTP (port 80) and/or HTTPS (port 443) traffic.
  
2. **Public IP Address**: Be aware that if the EC2 instance's public IP changes (if it's not an Elastic IP), you may need to update the Caddyfile or DNS settings accordingly.

3. **Domain Name (Optional)**: If you are using a domain name, make sure to point your DNS A record to your EC2 instance's public IP.

4. **Caddy on Port 80/443**: Ensure that Caddy is set to respond on the appropriate ports and is running as a service within your Docker container.

This setup will allow Caddy to serve as a reverse proxy, directing incoming traffic to your `gatewayapi` service.
