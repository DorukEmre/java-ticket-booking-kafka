## üß© 1. EC2 Network Settings Overview

When you launch an EC2 instance, under **Network Settings ‚Üí Firewall (security group)**, AWS gives you these options:

* ‚úÖ **Allow SSH traffic from anywhere (port 22)** ‚Äì for you to connect
* ‚úÖ **Allow HTTP traffic from the internet (port 80)** ‚Äì optional
* ‚úÖ **Allow HTTPS traffic from the internet (port 443)** ‚Äì optional

These simply pre-create inbound rules in a **Security Group**.
You can fine-tune them **after launch** ‚Äî and that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll do.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Default Behavior (if you check the boxes)

If you **check both HTTP and HTTPS**, AWS will create inbound rules like:

| Type  | Protocol | Port | Source               |
| ----- | -------- | ---- | -------------------- |
| HTTP  | TCP      | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere) |
| HTTPS | TCP      | 443  | 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere) |

That means *anyone on the internet* can reach your EC2 via ports 80 and 443.

Fine for a public API, **not fine if you want to restrict access** (e.g., only your frontend or IP).

---

## üîí 3. Restricting Access to Specific Address or Origin

### ‚úÖ Option A ‚Äî Restrict by IP (Network-level security)

If your frontend is hosted at a provider with a **known IP or IP range**, you can restrict EC2 inbound traffic.

#### Steps:

1. Go to the EC2 dashboard ‚Üí **Security Groups** ‚Üí select your instance‚Äôs group.
2. Under **Inbound Rules**, edit and replace `0.0.0.0/0` with:

   * The **static IP** or **CIDR range** of your frontend host.

Example:

| Type  | Protocol | Port | Source            |
| ----- | -------- | ---- | ----------------- |
| HTTPS | TCP      | 443  | `203.0.113.42/32` |

That allows only that single IP.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:

* Some frontend hosts (e.g. Netlify, Vercel) use dynamic IPs ‚Äî you can‚Äôt whitelist reliably.
* If that‚Äôs the case, you‚Äôll need app-level controls (see below).

---

### ‚úÖ Option B ‚Äî Restrict by Origin (App-level control)

Use Caddy or your backend‚Äôs logic to **allow requests only from your frontend domain**.

#### Example Caddyfile:

```caddyfile
{
    email admin@example.com
}

your-backend-domain.com {
    reverse_proxy api-gateway:8080
    header Access-Control-Allow-Origin https://your-frontend.com
    header Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET,POST,OPTIONS"
}
```

This doesn‚Äôt stop packets from other IPs, but prevents cross-origin access from browsers ‚Äî so only your frontend site can interact properly.

---

### ‚úÖ Option C ‚Äî Combine Both (Best Practice)

* Restrict by IP if possible (in Security Group)
* Also restrict by origin at the app/proxy level (in Caddy or backend)
* Optionally use an API key or JWT for backend authentication.

## üåê 4. Example Setup Summary

| Layer         | Security Type | Tool               | Example Rule                                         |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Network (AWS) | IP-based      | EC2 Security Group | Allow 443 only from `203.0.113.42/32`                |
| Proxy (App)   | Origin-based  | Caddy              | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin https://myfrontend.com` |
| API (Logic)   | Auth-based    | JWT / API Key      | Required for requests                                |

---

## üß† TL;DR

* **Check ‚ÄúAllow HTTP & HTTPS from the internet‚Äù** at instance creation (it‚Äôs safe; you can restrict later).
* After launch, go to **Security Group ‚Üí Inbound rules**:

  * Replace `0.0.0.0/0` with your frontend‚Äôs IP or CIDR block.
* If your frontend has dynamic IPs ‚Üí control access in **Caddy (CORS)** or via **API authentication**.

Would you like me to show you an example **Caddyfile** that automatically handles HTTPS (via Let‚Äôs Encrypt) and enforces CORS only for your frontend domain? It‚Äôs a perfect fit for your AWS setup.
